        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Since the dawn of the 21st century, human society has experienced the rapidly developing economy, which the well-being of the people has improved drastically. However, the increasing of average revenue of the people also has been bringing a problem for the people, which is over consuming of the calories, prompting the widespread of sub-health, the phenomenon of the poor health of the modern human, of the people such as chronic disease, obesity and heart disease, which caused the decline of the economy and the up of the public health expenditure etc. According to the data of Global Data, the obesity epidemic in New York has resulted in economic losses amounting to as much as $37.3 billion for the city in 2022 and increased the budget of the medical spending by $1.5 billion. Therefore, the crisis of calories has forced the government to enact the policy to reduce or mediate the problem, which created the sugary drink tax, taxing the commodity of the high rate of the contain sugar. </p><h1 id="Current-Result-of-the-Sugary-Drink-Tax"><a href="#Current-Result-of-the-Sugary-Drink-Tax" class="headerlink" title="Current Result of the Sugary Drink Tax"></a>Current Result of the Sugary Drink Tax</h1><h2 id="United-Kingdom"><a href="#United-Kingdom" class="headerlink" title="United Kingdom"></a>United Kingdom</h2><p>The United Kingdom enact the sugary drink tax which name as “Soft Drinks Industry Levy” in the 2016 United Kingdom budget and the tax officially implemented on 6 April 2018, taxing the beverage manufacturers according to the volume of sugar-sweetened beverages they produced or imported, which is what the total sugar content of drinks above 5g per 100 milliliter is taxed at 18 penny per liter and the drink above 8g per 100 milliliter is taxed at 24 penny per liter.<br>Since the levy is implemented, the effect of reducing sugar consumption was decreased. According to the researchers from LSHTM, London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, adults’ sugar intake fell by more than 7.1g per day. </p><p>Moreover, the figures from the University of Cambridge show that the estimated average daily consumption of sugar had decreased by almost 5g per day for children and almost 11g for adults compared to the expected level if the tax had not been introduced.</p><h2 id="United-States-of-America"><a href="#United-States-of-America" class="headerlink" title="United States of America"></a>United States of America</h2><p>The USA has not a national sugary drink tax ending in 2024, but some of cities has introduced the tax. For example, Berkeley, a city in California, imposed a tax of one cent per ounce on the distributors of specified sugar-sweetened beverages such as soda, sport drinks and energy drinks in 2014 and Oakland, a city in California, also introduced a tax for the soda drink, which taxed one cent per ounce of soda drink in 2017 .</p><p>Since the tax is implemented, the research from PLoS Med, a journal of Medicine, showed that purchases of healthier drinks increased while the sales of the sugary drinks decreased in Berkeley. However, according to the another study from Am J Public Health, a journal of Medicine, in Oakland, the purchases of beverages increased by 10% and the water intake only increased by 19% after the tax is introduced a year later.</p><h1 id="Doubt-of-the-Sugary-Drink-Tax"><a href="#Doubt-of-the-Sugary-Drink-Tax" class="headerlink" title="Doubt of the Sugary Drink Tax"></a>Doubt of the Sugary Drink Tax</h1><p>By analyse the results of the implement of sugary drinks tax of some of the countries, it is unquestionably that the sugary drink tax is an illusion of success which is unsustainable policy that not only harms the economy of a country but also encroaches on the freedom of choice of the people while the ineffective tax imposed by the government.</p><h2 id="The-Damage-of-the-Economy"><a href="#The-Damage-of-the-Economy" class="headerlink" title="The Damage of the Economy"></a>The Damage of the Economy</h2><p>Sugary Drink Tax make a decrease of the revenue of the beverage manufactures by increasing the cost of production and the selling price, in all probability, causing the employee unemployment and the decline of the economy.</p><p>In addition, the measure not only cause a breakdown of the industry of beverage but also create a black hole of the governmental expense if it will proliferate as it has the cost of taxation which the research from Appl Health Econ Health Policy, a journal of publishing practical health economic articles, showed that the cost of the intervention higher than<br>US$2.177 billion in the worst situation from the high-quality fifteen studies of six representative countries, squeezed out fiscal expenditures of other effective policies to give a apply a negative impact of the development of the economy of a country in the long run.</p><h2 id="The-Aggressive-of-the-Freedom"><a href="#The-Aggressive-of-the-Freedom" class="headerlink" title="The Aggressive of the Freedom"></a>The Aggressive of the Freedom</h2><p>It is an aggressive of the freedom of the people obviously as sugary drink tax virtually is a Pigouvian tax in term of economy to create a negative externality to force the participant of the market to reduce the purchases of the beverages as well as infringe the principle of self-choice right. </p><h2 id="The-Suspicion-of-the-Effectiveness"><a href="#The-Suspicion-of-the-Effectiveness" class="headerlink" title="The Suspicion of the Effectiveness"></a>The Suspicion of the Effectiveness</h2><p>The effectiveness of sugary drink tax has been doubted since it cannot directly regulate the consumption of sugar of the people to control the rate of fatness as it only has been authorized the government to tax the beverage and has been excluded a majority of the intake of energy is made by carbohydrates such as polished white rice, according to the research from ScienceDirect.</p><h1 id="The-Conclusion"><a href="#The-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="The Conclusion"></a>The Conclusion</h1><p>Sugary drink tax is not only neither a progression of the human right nor a driver of economy and obesity but also a regress of the freedom and a factor of the decline of the economy. It is unanimous that the problem of the overweight should be solved or mitigated but sugary drink tax must not be a path to succeed.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>In the past decades, Japanese culture strongly influences  lives, work and hobbies of Hongkongers. While Japanese culture has dominated other foreign cultures, the subversion of the rule is creeping, which Korean culture is gradually becoming more popular among young people. In this essay, I will explore the reason why it has been winning the love from they by delving into the history of the world and the mental of the Gen Z.</p><h1 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h1><p>To understand why people loved Japanese culture in past, we need to look back to 60s, which is the golden time of Japan. In that time, Japan is the most prosperous country in Asia, caused its cultural products which became the name of high quality dominated others at every regions and Hong Kong was one of them. However, the situation is changing nowadays by Korean culture is popular with young people by time.</p><h1 id="Reasons-of-the-Rising"><a href="#Reasons-of-the-Rising" class="headerlink" title="Reasons of the Rising"></a>Reasons of the Rising</h1><h2 id="First-Reason"><a href="#First-Reason" class="headerlink" title="First Reason"></a>First Reason</h2><p>The share of Korean culture is raised by modern cultural products from Korean. Nowadays, Japan is not only one of the country which can create fascinating cultural products. For instance, K-pop , a type of popular music which derived in Korea, which make is fashionable and prevalent among younger, prompting the culture to spread to young people in Hong Kong. Furthermore, what culture of Korea is more suitable for modern world compares with stagnate Japanese culture which Japan has been struggling with economic crisis starting in the 80s. For example, the Korean music likes to use exhilarating rhythm and fashionable clothes while the Japanese music is more soothing and sad though it seem contemporary such as Gangnam Style —— a Korea music and Remioromen —— a Japanese music. Obviously, former is more suitable for young people. Thus, stylish culture product from Korea is one of the reason why the young people more and more like the Korean culture.</p><h2 id="Second-Reason"><a href="#Second-Reason" class="headerlink" title="Second Reason"></a>Second Reason</h2><p>In addition, what Japanese culture is boring for youth is one of reason for the situation. Gen Z is desired the new Korean culture than the decrepit Japanese culture due to the time that later rules people in Hong Kong is too long. For young people, the Japanese culture means old and tedious so that young people wanted something is refreshing and Korean culture took the opportunity. It utilizes the social media which is used by youth people and other youth elements such as dance, light, slang to spread itself widely for freshness.</p><h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>In conclusion, the rising of Korea culture due to its cultural products which is more refreshing and modern than Japanese cultural products is popular in young people in Hong Kong. As the time passes by, is the Korea culture will become the new Japanese cultural? The time will answer the question.</p>]]></content>
